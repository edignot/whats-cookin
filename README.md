### About

 "What's Cookin'?" is a recipe tracking and meal planning application that allows users to search and save recipes. The application also keeps track of a user's pantry, and can let the user know if they want to cook a recipe, whether or not the have enough ingredients available to do so. If not, they will be informed as to which ingredients they need, so that they may add them to their shopping list.
This project was a paired project during Module 2 at [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.io/).

* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation

* Display information on the page while maintaining ability to test class properties and methods

* Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way
